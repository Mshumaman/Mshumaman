### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm an automation software engineer with a background in sociology, anthropology, and philosophy. I am currently working with Playwright and TypeScript, and am always looking to learn new technologies and skills.

Currently, I am learning React and working towards my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.
