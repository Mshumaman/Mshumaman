### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

i'm a software Quality Assurance tester and automation student at Gal Matalon's automation.co.il. I can describe myself as fast learner, autodidact who don't worry about dealing with new challenges and assignments. I'm a team player that at the same time highly independent and motivated to learn as much as possible in order to develop my skills.

In addition, I am a BA in Sociology Anthropology and Philosophy, a field which encourage the development of critical thinking, out-of-the-box thinking and creativity.
